# gfc-playground

The journey thus travelled...

We have been iteratively evolving as a community and have attempted to give a vauge representation https://whimsical.com/gitfitcode-s-professional-software-playground-EPKQF79z7hrAJCEedhL3V of our interactions. There have been some ways in which this has been used over the years that the community has found valuable. At this point the community has 156 members. The value that members get from this graph visualization of our engagements varies. The AIM that the gfc has with this playground is to support members even more... So lets grow this so its valuable.. 

So on that note, lets dive into the value that the basic graph representation provided gfc members...

1. It describe the structure of our professional playground
2. Provides a bird's eye view of the potential interactions that could support in your journey as a practicioner in your own right
